/**
 * <p>
 * This role allows extending the patient record with custom data. The basic patient class only knows how to handle a
 * few essential patient record entries, while additional data can be made available, in a modular way, by custom
 * implementations of this role.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #load(Patient)} method is responsible for populating a {@link Patient} object with actual data from the
 * patient record. Data read from the record can be accessed using the {@link Patient}'s {@link Patient#getData(String)
 * custom data access method}. The {@link #save(Patient)} method is responsible for storing back into the database the
 * custom data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #writeJSON(Patient, JSONObject)} method serializes custom data into the JSON being generated for a
 * patient, and {@link #readJSON(JSONObject)} reads back data from a JSON into a patient record. Since different
 * components might serialize their custom data into the same JSON property, the {@link #writeJSON(Patient, JSONObject)}
 * method should not always create a new property, but first try to extend an existing one.
 * </p>
